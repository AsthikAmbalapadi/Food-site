                <h1>THE FOOD YOU LOVE</h1>
                <P>People who love to eat are always the best people. To eat is a necessity, but to eat intelligently is an art. We all eat, an it would be a sad waste of opportunity to eat badly. 
                    If you really want to make a friend, go to someone's house and eat with him. The people who give you their food, give you their heart.</P>
